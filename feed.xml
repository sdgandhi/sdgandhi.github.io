<p>We find ourselves moving from one task to the next, one notification after another. We don't get the idle time of old when our thoughts might drift to a friend or family member.</p>
<p>If we could keep in touch with our loved ones we would have more fulfilling relationships and feel less lonely. <em>Ketchup</em> helps you do just that, keep in touch. Not with profiles, but with meaningful conversations...like the old days.</p>

                <p>During my work on iOS releases 9, 10 and 11 I wrote much of the API for ridesharing in Siri and Apple Maps and drove adoption with Uber, Lyft, Ola Cabs and DiDi. This allowed users to compare prices between different providers and take full rides without leaving Siri at all. After launch, my team supported 50k+ requests per week across millions of iPhones.</p>
<p>I also helped the launch of the Apple Maps transit feature in Japan, which launched with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210728224354/https://atadistance.net/2016/11/13/im-at-shinjuku-station-but-which-shinjuku-station-are-you-talking-about-a-review-of-apple-maps-japan-transit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210728224736/https://www.amvsement.com/2016/11/travel-japan-apple-maps-transport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a> for the detail-oriented design and features which helped users efficiently navigate Japan's complex transit system.</p>
