                <p>I wanted to redesign our living room interior to make it more comfortable to host our friends and family. Of course, we can make the process better with software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweethome3d.com"><strong>Sweet Home 3D</strong></a> is a free interior design application that helps you draw the plan of your house, arrange furniture on it and visit the results in 3D.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--full" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.29.36-PM.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.29.36-PM-xs.png 300w ,https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.29.36-PM-sm.png 480w ,https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.29.36-PM-md.png 768w"  alt="Sweet Home 3D example layout" width="3104" height="1834">
<figcaption >Our living room in Sweet Home 3D</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I measured every wall in our house to create the floor plan. Next, brought in 3D models from the included library and the internet (<a href="https://sketchfab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sketchfab</a> is a good place to start). The UI is a bit old school, but it's richly featured, so whatever you're looking for is there. <em>You'll figure it out.</em></p>
<p>Sweet Home has a render option that lets you get higher quality images with better lighting, and the results are... okay.B</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/axis-803-5.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/axis-803-5-xs.png 300w ,https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/axis-803-5-sm.png 480w ,https://sidhantgandhi.com/media/posts/16/responsive/axis-803-5-md.png 768w"  alt="Example render from Sweet Home 3D" width="2000" height="1125">
<figcaption >Example render from Sweet Home 3D</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can do better though. So we export the whole house with <em><strong>3D view &gt; Export to OBJ format.</strong></em> Next, import the .obj file in Blender, add some lights, adjust render settings and you get a much higher quality render.</p>

<p>We find ourselves moving from one task to the next, one notification after another. We don't get the idle time of old when our thoughts might drift to a friend or family member.</p>
<p>If we could keep in touch with our loved ones we would have more fulfilling relationships and feel less lonely. <em>Ketchup</em> helps you do just that, keep in touch. Not with profiles, but with meaningful conversations...like the old days.</p>
