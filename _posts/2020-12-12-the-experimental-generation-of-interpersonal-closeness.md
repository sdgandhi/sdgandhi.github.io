In January of 2015 in the Modern Love section of The New York Times, Mandy Len Catron wrote about a psychology study on interpersonal closeness that she tried in her own life which resulted in her getting close to (and eventually marrying) an acquaintance of hers.

I've become fascinated with how efficiently we use our time when we're with other people, especially considering how much less time we are in real personal interactions. Mixing 'efficiency' and 'friendship' seem to bring a bad taste into people's mouth, the argument being friendship doesn't need to be efficient, it's a casual and natural social phenomenon. However, because I find myself with increasingly limited and 'scheduled' time with friends, I find efficiency to be an alluring topic with regards to getting closer to my friends and family.

**The study** — The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings by Arthur Aron et al.

I read the study that the NYT article referred to which was published in 1997. It has plenty of references to previous work in this area which as been going on since the 1970s. But in true 'scientific' fashion it's a boring read so I'll summarize it for readers who value efficiency: 

# Key takeaways

1. 3 separate studies were conducted which were modeled on previous studies in interpersonal closeness. These studies had subject pairs ask each other increasingly intimate (not in the physical sense) questions to increase closeness between the subjects.
2. In study 1, researchers found that the intimate questions generated a score of 4.06 on a specific closeness scale, while the control 'small talk' questions were 3.25. They considered this a significant difference — meaning the intimate questions worked!
3. In study 2, researchers matched subjects based on certain preferences/values (do you smoke, should people dress conservatively) and whether there was an expectation that the other person liked them. They found no strong effect of either of these variables on the resulting closeness score (4.02 in this case)

    > Overall these data suggest that matching in terms of not disagreeing on important attitudes or leading subjects to believe that they and their partners will like each other probably has little impact on the overall closeness subjects achieve through this procedure...

4. In study 3, researches manipulated the variable of whether they told subjects that achieving closeness was a goal or not. Overall score was a bit lower at 3.76, but researchers claimed it to not be a significant difference.

In the conclusion of the study:

> So are we producing real closeness? Yes and no. We think the closeness produced in these studies is experienced as similar in many important ways to felt closeness in naturally occurring relationships that develop over time. ON the other hand, it seems unlikely that procedure produces loyalty, dependence, commitment, or other relationship aspects that might time longer to develop.

# So...what?

If you want to achieve closeness with people around you, new and known, you can use the same questions Aron et al. used in their study. Remember, the order matters here since they get increasingly personal and intimate. 

## The questions

## Thoughts on using the questions

I imagine introducing these questions to a new acquaintance with *"So you want to get closer by asking each other personal questions?"* may not be the ideal approach. A useful introduction might be *"I want to get to know you better. Want to do this activity that's supposed to build closer friendships? We just go back and forth asking each other questions."*

Then you might proceed to go back and forth answering questions. One option would be for each person to answer each questions. Another might be to alternate questions.

### Missing section

In the NYT article, the author mentions a section of the procedure to be done after finishing the questions: silently stare into each other's eyes for four minutes. While very interesting, I didn't find this part of the experiment in the study.
